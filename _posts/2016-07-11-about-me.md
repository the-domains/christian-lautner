# About me

Thanks for your interest.

I am co-founder of FLYING HEALTH Incubator, a Berlin (Germany) based health incubator focussing on concepts for digital diagnosis and therapy -- software as a drug. For more please find [www.flyinghealth.com][0] .

I am down-to-earth. You will not find me flying around as I don't have a pilot's licence :-). My passion is running and I try to run wherever I am travelling to. For a chat, catch me while running at Berlin-government-quarter (Regierungsviertel) and park Tiergarten or travel locations. Looking forward to meeting and talking to you.

Some more, I am

* Appreciating modesty.
* Believing in simplicity.
* Getting things done.
* Fascinated with health startups.
