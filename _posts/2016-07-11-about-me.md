# About me

Thanks for your interest. This is my personal website which will cover my personal experience and opinion on topics entrepreneurship & running. Moreover, I love technology. This website is built by [thegrid.io][0] which has the great vision of "AI websites that design themselves". I have been following this project with great interest for a while as I firmly believe that the possibilites of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence will have useful applications in almost all areas of life, in particular in my home-turf: health. 

I am co-founder of FLYING HEALTH Incubator, a Berlin (Germany) based health incubator focussing on concepts for digital diagnosis and therapy -- software as a drug. For more please find [www.flyinghealth.com][1] or contact me via personal message on [linkedin][2] or [twitter][3]. Best chance to catch me for a chat is early morning running at Berlin-government-quarter (Regierungsviertel) and park Tiergarten or at my travel locations. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/87bada6f-30cf-44c9-aa4a-21c4c8043c12.jpg)
