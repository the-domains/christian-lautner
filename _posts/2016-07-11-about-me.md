# About me

Thanks for your interest. This is my personal website which will cover my personal experience and opinion on topics entrepreneurship & running. Moreover, I love technology and this website is built by [thegrid.io.][0] I have been following thegrid.io with great interest for a while as I firmly believe that the possibilites of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence will have useful applications in almost all areas of life, in particular in my home-turf: health. 

I am co-founder of FLYING HEALTH Incubator, a Berlin (Germany) based health incubator focussing on concepts for digital diagnosis and therapy -- software as a drug. For more please find [www.flyinghealth.com][1].

I am down-to-earth. You will not find me flying around as I don't have a pilot's licence :-). My passion is running and I try to run wherever I am travelling to. For a chat, catch me while running at Berlin-government-quarter (Regierungsviertel) and park Tiergarten or travel locations. Looking forward to meeting and talking to you.
